# Examples

This section describes the example programs in detail and explains how to
use them.

## Installing the example programs

There are lots of example programs in the `examples` folder. You can run any
of these using the `go run` command or compile and install them using `go install`.
The examples demonstrate various features of the `gopi` package. For example:

  * `helloworld_example.go` Simply displays the canonical simplest program in Go
  * `log_example.go` Demonstates how to write your own logger class. In this case
      it logs to a file rather than to the console.
  * `windowing_example.go` Demonstates how to draw onto the screen using the
      GPU.
  * `gpio_example.go` Demonstrates how to use the GPIO interface on the Raspberry Pi.
  * `led_example.go` Demonstrates how to use the GPIO interface on the Raspberry Pi
	to blink an LED.
