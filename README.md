# Introduction

This repository contains a golang framework for the Raspberry Pi, which
will allow you to develop applications which utilize the Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) for image and video encoding/decoding and 2D and 3D graphics,
and various external hardware devices like mouse, keyboard, touchscreen,
GPIO, I2C and Camera.

More information on usage is available at http://djthorpe.github.io/gopi/
